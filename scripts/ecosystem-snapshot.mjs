/**
 * Keep every surface that quotes the ecosystem numbers in step with the report.
 *
 * There are four of them — the web app, the repository README, the npm
 * package README, and the report's own Markdown — and they had already drifted
 * apart once: the landing page claimed 13,350 endpoints against the report's
 * 13,380, because the report was regenerated and the JSX was not. A figure that
 * is wrong in one place and right in three is worse than one that is wrong
 * everywhere, because nobody can tell which to believe.
 *
 * So nothing downstream keeps its own copy. The pipeline is:
 *
 *   reports/ecosystem-<day>.json    the full run — ~16 MB, names every server
 *     ↓  extractSummary()               probed, and gitignored for that reason
 *   reports/summary.json            ~1 KB of aggregates, committed
 *     ↓  renderSurfaces()
 *   web/lib/ecosystem-snapshot.ts   what the site reads
 *   README.md                       between the ecosystem-snapshot markers
 *   packages/cli/README.md          likewise
 *
 * The split at `summary.json` is what lets CI check the second half. It cannot
 * run the first — the 16 MB input is not in the repository — but it can
 * re-render every surface from the committed summary and fail if one moved.
