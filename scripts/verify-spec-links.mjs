/**
 * Verify that every rule's `specRef` still says what the rule claims it says.
 *
 * A status check is not enough, and this project has the receipt: the original
 * refs were `…/2026-07-28#lifecycle` and friends. Those return 200. The server
 * happily serves the overview page and the fragment matches nothing, so a link
 * checker passes all seven while every citation is wrong.
 *
 * So each ref is paired with a marker — a phrase that appears on the page it is
 * supposed to be and nowhere near the overview page. Fetch, look for the marker,
 * fail loudly if it is gone. That catches a moved page, a rewritten section, and
 * a silent redirect, none of which a 200 distinguishes.
 *
 * The marker table is deliberately here rather than in rules.ts: the rules are
 * shipped to users, this is maintenance. The coverage check at the bottom keeps
 * the two from drifting — a new rule with no marker fails the run.
 *
 * Suggested by Mads Hansen in the comments on the write-up.
