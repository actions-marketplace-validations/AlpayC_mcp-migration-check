 * go-sdk/v2` — the proxy 404s it — and there never was a package rename. The
 * official SDK crossed inside its v1 line, at the v1.6.1 -> v1.7.0 *minor*.
 * A major-version threshold, which is the shape MCP007, MCP009 and MCP010 all
 * use, would therefore never fire here. That is exactly the mistake MCP007
 * made in the other direction when it recommended a `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
 * 2.x that has never existed, so the threshold is a full release triple.
 *
 * Verified 2026-09-03 against the module proxy and the module source:
 * go-sdk v1.6.1 `mcp/shared.go` still says `protocolVersion20251125`; v1.7.0
 * says `latestProtocolVersion = protocolVersion20260728`. mark3labs mcp-go
 * v0.58.0 says `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION = "2025-11-25"`; v1.0.0 says
 * `ProtocolVersion20260728`.
 *
 * Modules deliberately absent: `metoro-io/mcp-golang`, `ThinkInAIXYZ/go-mcp`,
 * `riza-io/mcp-go`, `strowk/foxy-contexts`. None has a release speaking this
 * revision, so "upgrade" would be advice with no target — the same reasoning
